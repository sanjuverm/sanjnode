  <p>I'm lucky enough to have some of writing featured on Huffington Post and TechCrunch.
    <br>I'm currently updating my blog so that acts more as a <a href="http://www.nocityfornomads.com">space for my writing</a>, and every month, I write a <a href="http://tinyletter.com/sanjuverm">Product Manager Story </a>

  					<h2>Huffington Post</h2>
  					<p>Started writing for the Huffington Post a little over a year ago now. I get to write about a whole range of topics</p>
  					<h2>Some things I've written about:</h2>

  					<h2>Tech Crunch</h2>
  					<p>When it comes to enterprising startups, I was able to contribute a story to Tech Crunch in February of this year. </p>
  					<h2>BOXFOX</h2>
  					<p>BOXFOX is one of LA's coolest startups, in my opinion. The three female cofounders are enhancing strategy and technology to make one of lifeâ€™s favorite moments, gift giving, easier and more customizable than ever before. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/01/meet-the-foxes-behind-las-latest-startup-gem/"  >You can read the TechCrunch feature I wrote here!</a></p>

            <br>
  					<h2>Side Writing</h2>
  					<p>I like to write about my travels (as does anyone), and share it on my <a href="http:www.instagram.com/sanjuverm"  >Instagram</a> as well as my Squarespace blog.</p>
  					<h2>Product Manager Stories</h2>
  					<p>A purposeful play on words, I wanted PMS to be a monthly newsletter that focuses on a cool PM in industry and/or if I were lucky enough to be a PM at a firm, how I would run a certain feature. My first PM Story was if I were a PM working on Instagram Stories.</p>

  					<h2>Features</h2>
  					<p>Sometimes people think I do cool things, too!</p>
